<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully transformed a fragmented admission process into a unified web application for Frage EDU, starting with an MVP and incrementally adding features. Key accomplishments include a robust authentication and token system, a multi-section admission portal, and a comprehensive website redesign. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback, from adding consent popups and PDF integration to a complete site structure overhaul and implementing a blog-style rich editor for news. Debugging compile errors, including JSX issues and duplicate function declarations, was handled efficiently. The most recent work involves expanding the admin portal, with the engineer currently adding member management, following a detailed proposal from the user.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a responsive web app and PWA for Frage EDU, unifying parent admissions and community features currently split across Naver Band, Kakao, and Google Forms. Parents need to sign up, verify email, and receive a  for admission data (Consent, Forms, Guides, Checklist). The admission portal displays a banner, three card sections with status, and a checklist. Privacy rules dictate token-based access.

**MVP Priorities:**
1.  **Parent Signup + Admission Portal:** Web signup (email, phone, password, ToS),  generation, redirect to a dashboard. Implement Consent, Forms, Guides, and Checklist pages with token-based privacy rules.
2.  **Teacher–Parent Chat:** Grouped channels by topic (absences, transport, Q&A), quick-action buttons, Google Sheets integration for logging.
3.  **Frage Market:** E-commerce module (product, cart, checkout) to avoid SmartStore fees.

**Key Features Implemented/Requested:**
*   Consent forms: Detailed popups for each item, PDF rendering, and parent/student name integration with timestamped agreement.
*   Full Website Structure: Homepage, About, Programs, Admissions, News, Footer.
*   Exam Reservation Flow: For junior/middle school (not kindergarten), Tally integration for initial reservations, campus/slot selection, notes, consent, database record creation, and a confirmation page.
*   Admin System: For managing news content (create, read, update, delete) with categories (All, Openings, Notices, News) and a blog-style rich editor supporting Markdown and image uploads.
*   Extended Admin Management: User/parent management, application/consent management, exam reservation/results management, class assignment/registration, communication/notifications, reports/statistics, and role-based permissions.
*   Brand identity: Use , remove tagline, make logo clickable to home.
*   Community section: Removed as per user request.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of implementing the comprehensive Admin management system, based on the user's detailed proposal in Chat Message 278.

The engineer's recent actions include:
1.  **Adding Admin Login to Header**: Modified  and  to include an Admin login option directly in the main website's header. This allows administrators to log in from any public page.
2.  **Preparing Backend APIs**: Edited  to extend the backend with necessary API endpoints for the new administrative features. This likely involves new models and routes for managing various aspects like users, applications, exams, etc.
3.  **Extending Frontend Admin System**: Updated  to add new routes and integrate the new frontend components for the expanded admin portal.
4.  **Initiating Member Management**: The very last action stated was, 이제 회원 관리 시스템을 추가하겠습니다: (Now I will add the member management system). This indicates the engineer has just begun working on the first section of the proposed comprehensive admin portal, specifically focusing on displaying, searching, filtering, and managing member/parent details.
