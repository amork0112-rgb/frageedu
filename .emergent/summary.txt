The AI engineer successfully built the initial Frage EDU application and then significantly enhanced it based on user feedback. The work began with syncing the codebase from GitHub, which required resolving local workspace inconsistencies. Key features implemented include a robust admission flow system with automated progress tracking and detailed data storage. A major focus was the development of a next-generation parent dashboard, featuring dynamic, role/branch-specific content rendering. Frontend login and registration issues were debugged, revealing a critical  mismatch, where the frontend was pointing to a non-functional external URL. This was ultimately resolved for admin login by creating a new admin user directly on the external environment. Additionally, a comprehensive Find ID/Reset Password system was built, evolving to use student/parent demographic data. The latest task involves implementing a detailed Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for admin users, including branch-specific data access, which is currently facing issues with the student listing API. The AI engineer consistently prioritized user requirements and systematically debugged issues, demonstrating strong problem-solving skills.

<product_requirements>
The core product is the Frage EDU web application, aiming to unify admission and community features.
**Initial Build (by previous AI engineer):**
*   **Parent Signup:** Email, phone, password, ToS, , redirect to dashboard. Enhanced with student birthdate and branch (Kinder, Junior, Middle).
*   **Admission Portal:** Conditional welcome page (consultation vs. full guide based on admin enrollment).
*   **Website Structure:** Homepage, About, Programs, Admissions, News, Footer. Admin login moved to footer.
*   **Admin System:** Comprehensive member management (list, view, update, bulk actions, audit logs) and news content CRUD.
*   **Frage Market:** Full e-commerce platform (products, cart, order management).
*   **Enhanced Parent Dashboard:** Detailed, branch-specific, status-aware dashboard with progress, exams, timetable, homework, attendance, billing, notices, resources, multi-child support, and conditional card rendering.

**Current Phase Requirements (from trajectory):**
*   **Admission Procedure Summary (Operational Table):** Define specific flows for Kinder Regular, Kinder Transfer, Junior, Middle, Kinder Single, with detailed steps (e.g., Seminar → Application → Payment → Consent → Class Assignment).
*   **Automated Dashboard Progress Update:** Auto-update enrollment steps based on events (e.g., , , , , ).
*   **Admin Filters/Reports:** Implement filters for , , , , . Define conversion funnels.
*   **AlimTalk Notifications:** Automated notifications upon stage changes (e.g., Application Not Submitted, Payment Pending).
*   **Welcome Page Modification:** For kinder branch, remove consultation or level test sections, leaving only inquiry information.
*   **Find ID/Password:** Implement Forgot ID/Password functionality. Initially based on email, then improved to use Parent Name + Student Name + Student Birthdate.
*   **Robust Admin Login:** Ensure reliable admin login.
*   **Registration Fix:** Resolve issues preventing new user registration.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Admin:**
    *   **Roles:**  (full access),  (kinder only),  (junior, kinder_single, middle),  (middle only).
    *   **Permissions:** Granular toggles (e.g., , , , ).
    *   **Data Access Filters:** Branch whitelist per admin user.
    *   **Super Admin UI:** Interface to manage roles, allowed branches, and permissions.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Record all permission/branch changes.
*   **Student Management UI (Admin):** Redesign with search, filters (branch, status, grade), quick action buttons (new student, Excel export), main table with student list, side panel/modal for student details (profile, progress, attendance, grades, payments, actions), and activity logs. Access filtered by RBAC.

</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend.



- **/app/backend/server.py**:
    - **Importance:** This file is the core of the FastAPI backend, centralizing all API endpoints, MongoDB database models (Pydantic), and business logic. It handles authentication, data management for users, parents, students, admissions, market, and now the advanced dashboard and RBAC.
    - **Changes:**
        - **Extensive Pydantic Models:** Added models for , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , .
        - **Authentication & User Management:** Updated signup to initialize admission flows and correctly pass student branch data. Implemented Find Username (by parent/student name/birthdate) and Reset Password APIs.
        - **Admission Flow APIs:** , , .
        - **Parent Dashboard APIs:**  (new comprehensive dashboard API), .
        - **Admin Management APIs:** , , .
        - **RBAC APIs:** , , , , ,  (student listing with RBAC filtering).
        - **Utilities:** Added , , , , .
        - **Dependencies:** Ensured  and other required packages are listed in .
        - **Error Handling:** Fixed ObjectId serialization and other minor issues.
- **/app/frontend/src/App.js**:
    - **Importance:** This is the main React component, serving as the application's entry point, handling routing, central state management, and housing many critical components and pages.
    - **Changes:**
        - **Routing:** Added new routes for , ,  (later ), , , , . Updated login/signup redirection logic.
        - **Components:** Integrated  (modified for kinder-specific content),  (new component for the enhanced parent dashboard, includes 8 conditional cards), , ,  (debugged form selectors).
        - **UI Modifications:** Updated  and  integration (Admin link moved to footer, Market removed from header). Conditional rendering logic for dashboard cards based on , , .
        - **Dependencies/Styling:** Imported  icon from .
        - **API Consumption:** Switched  from  to  for consistency.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was focused on implementing a comprehensive Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for administrators and enhancing the Student Management section.

**Work Accomplished:**
1.  **RBAC Data Models & APIs (Backend - ):**
    *   New Pydantic models: , , ,  were added.
    *   Utility functions:  and  were created to enforce branch-based filtering and permission checks.
    *   New RBAC-specific API endpoints:
        *   : Initializes default roles and permissions (super admin only).
        *   : Retrieves defined roles.
        *   : Retrieves master permissions.
        *   : Manages branches an admin can access.
        *   : Manages individual admin permissions.
        *   : Modified to filter students based on the logged-in admin's allowed branches and permissions.
2.  **RBAC System Initialization:** The RBAC system was successfully initialized using the  role (identified after debugging issues related to non-super admin roles and expired tokens).
3.  **Student Data Update:** During testing of the new  API, it was noted that existing test student data lacked the  and  fields. These fields were updated for existing students to ensure proper filtering.

**Current Issue:**
Despite RBAC initialization and student data updates, the  API is still returning  or empty data. The engineer is currently investigating this, suspecting a problem with the MongoDB aggregation pipeline within the  function in . The last action was to simplify the query in  to diagnose this issue.

<optional_next_step>
Debug the  API to correctly return student data, ensuring RBAC branch filtering works as expected.
